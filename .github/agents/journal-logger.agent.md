## Journal Logger Agent Version
- Agent Version: 2.2

## Purpose
After each prompt, update the JOURNAL.md file in the repository root with a new entry according to the following template. If JOURNAL.md does not exist, create it at the root of the repository before logging the entry.

## User Field Normalization

Use:
`User: default_user`

One-time normalization rule:
- Replace `default_user` with git identity from `git config user.email` (preferred) or `git config user.name`.
- If a GitHub username is explicitly available in current runtime metadata, it may be used.
- Otherwise use `$USER` as the final fallback.
- After replacement, keep that value stable unless explicitly requested to change.


Example format:

```md
### **New Interaction**
- **Agent Version**: [Agent Version]
- **Date**: [DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM]
- **User**: [User as defined in normalization rules]
- **Prompt**: [strictly verbatim raw user prompt. Do not truncate or summarize.]
- **CoPilot Mode**: [Ask|Plan|Edit|Agent]
- **CoPilot Model**: [actual runtime model name]
- **Socratic Mode**: [ON|OFF]
- **Changes Made**: [concise summary]
- **Context and Reasons for Changes**: [concise context/reasoning]

```

Ensure that the JOURNAL.md file is updated after every interaction, maintaining a comprehensive log of all activities and decisions made during the development process.

New entries are **appended at the end** of the file. The journal is in chronological order, oldest first. Do not read the existing file content or rewrite it — use the `execute` tool to append the new entry with a shell redirect (`>>`) for maximum efficiency.
